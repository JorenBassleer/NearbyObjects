# To Do
## Next steps
1. Increase zoom on (small) asteroids (+ increase size of everything)
2. Add more variable orbits + cap zoom (z-axis)
3. Add more asteroids (randomiser in which asteroid is used)

## Nice to haves
- Have zoom animation be increased on smaller asteroids?
- Better phone controls -> click on asteroid?
- distances in relation to distances between earth & moon
- Title screen; if user clicks on "enter/start" before everything is loaded, show loader. Otherwise just show the app. (Save in cookies to not show again)
- Click on asteroid & fetch more information about it(using the links and usch on it)
- [Project example](https://gitee.com/ice-gl/icegl-three-vue-tres/blob/master/src/plugins/UIdemo/pages/divIllustrate.vue)
