# To Do
## Next steps
1. Set all data to a relative scale (look for scales maybe first)
2. Have sort in list (Size, Dangerous ones/...)
3. Look to improve information Panel
4. Create Title screen
5. Add more asteroids (randomiser in which asteroid is used)

## Nice to haves
- Make clicking on asteroid possible
- Animate size on focus?
- Better phone controls
- distances in relation to distances between earth & moon
- Title screen; if user clicks on "enter/start" before everything is loaded, show loader. Otherwise just show the app. (Save in cookies to not show again)
