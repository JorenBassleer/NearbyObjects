# To Do
## Next steps
1. Have sort in list & fix on mobile (Size, Dangerous ones/...)
2. Look to improve information Panel (& positioning)
3. Create Title screen
4. Add more asteroids (randomiser in which asteroid is used)

## Nice to haves
- Make clicking on asteroid possible
- Have zoom animation be increased on smaller asteroids?
- Better phone controls -> click on asteroid?
- distances in relation to distances between earth & moon
- Title screen; if user clicks on "enter/start" before everything is loaded, show loader. Otherwise just show the app. (Save in cookies to not show again)
- Click on asteroid & fetch more information about it(using the links and usch on it)
